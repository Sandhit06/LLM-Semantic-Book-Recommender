Semantic Book Recommender Using LLMs
=================================================

This project utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) and semantic search to recommend books based on user input. It goes beyond traditional recommendation systems by using natural language understanding to find books with similar contextual meaning rather than relying on simple keyword matching.

## How to Use

1. **Prepare Your Environment: .**:
    Ensure you have Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Gradio installed.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourgithub/semantic-book-recommender.git
    ```

3. **Run the Detection**:
    Navigate to the cloned directory and run:
    ```sh
   python gradio-dashboard.py
    ```

## Detailed System Workflow

### Initialization and Configuration
- **Dataset Loading:** The system loads a dataset of books from `books_with_emotions.csv`, which contains book titles, descriptions, emotional tags, and cover images.
- **Text Processing:** The descriptions are preprocessed for embedding generation.
- **Vector Database Setup:** Uses Google Generative AI Embeddings to convert book descriptions into vector representations stored in ChromaDB.

### Semantic Search and Filtering
- **Embedding Search:** When a user enters a query, it is embedded and compared to book vectors to find the most relevant recommendations.
- **Emotional Tone Filtering:** Books can be filtered based on emotional tone such as suspenseful, joyful, or sad.
- **Category Filtering:** Users can refine recommendations by selecting a book category (e.g., Fiction, Non-Fiction).

### Interaction and UI
- **Gradio-Based Interface:** Provides an interactive UI where users can enter book descriptions and receive recommendations.
- **Book Display:** Shows book covers, titles, authors, and short descriptions in an easy-to-read gallery format.
- **Real-Time Recommendations:** Instantly updates based on user input.


## Customizations

You can adjust several parameters including:
-**Initial and Final Top-K** results for refining recommendations.
-**Embedding Model:** Can switch from Google AI to OpenAI embeddings.
-**Tone filtering logic** to enhance emotion-based sorting.

## Troubleshooting
No detections in the video
Ensure your model file is correctly loaded and the video file path is correct. Check if the video has clear visibility and minimal occlusions.

## âš  Disclaimer
This tool is developed for educational and developmental purposes. It's crucial to understand the implications and responsibilities of using such technologies in real-world applications.


## Tracking issues
Adjust the tracking parameters if the vehicles are not being consistently followed across frames.

## Performance is slow
Try reducing the video resolution or using a more powerful GPU. YOLOv8 is resource-intensive.
